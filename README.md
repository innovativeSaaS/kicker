SoqlBuilder:
Soqlbuilder  helps to generate the soql query to execute. On top of generating the access level, it does take care of validating FLS and CRUD access.
Validating FLS and CRUD access while generating the soql makes more sense as it helps to give instant feedback while building and makes code more clean and scalable.
